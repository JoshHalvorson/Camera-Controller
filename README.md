# Camera Controller
GUI that allows control over the camera using gphoto2.
Can control all settings on camera through the GUI, as well as take single shots or many shots in succession.

At the moment, I use this on a RaspberryPi so I can set up long exposures that need many shots to bring out the most detail. This way I can set it to take 30 shots at 30 seconds each, for example, and not have to worry about moving the camera by accident or anything.
